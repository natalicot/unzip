unpack [-r] [-v] file [file...]
Given a list of filenames as input, this script queries each target file (parsing the output of the
file command) for the type of compression used on it. Then the script automatically invokes
the appropriate decompression command, putting files in the same folder. If files with the
same name already exist, they are overwritten.
